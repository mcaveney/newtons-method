# newtons-method
A MATLAB function to find the roots of a mathematical function

Inputs- a vector of x values, a vector of y values, a starting x value

Outputs- a root found using Newton's method, number of new x values found

The function finds a root of a mathematical function by successively finding the roots of the 
tangent lines to that function. The algorithm converges to a root.
